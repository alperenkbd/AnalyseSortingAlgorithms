# Analyse Time Complexity For Sorting Algorithms
Sorting algorithms are powerful about understanding for time complexity of algorithms because include nested loops.  
The table at the below represents time complexities at three states.  
- Best Case
- Avarage Case
- Worst Case
We suppose sorting algorithms are on worst case.(for optimization)

**Sorting Algorithm** and **Time Complexities**     
|		   |	Best Case   |	Average Case  |	Worst Case
|:----------------:|:--------------:|:---------------:|:-----------:|
 Selection Sort	   |	  Ω(N2)	   |       Θ(N2) |  O(N2) |
 Insertion Sort	   |Ω(N)|Θ(N2)|  O(N2)
  
    
### Built With    
- dotnet core console application(ver 3.1.402)

### Usage
- Clone project to computer
- compile with 'dotnet run'
- choose data size between 10 and 10000
- choose your sorting algorithm
- thats it!
### Contributing
You can fork project and write new sorting algorithms.  
you can open a pull request too.
